# Rice-Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Using-Inception-V3-Algorithm
**Introduction:-**
One of the most important staple crops is rice, which is crucial to the world’s food security.
However, crop yield and global food production are seriously threatened by the illnesses that
are rapidly spreading among rice plants. Early disease diagnosis in rice plants is essential for
prompt treatment and efficient management to reduce possible losses. Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), a recent development in deep learning techniques, have demonstrated
astounding effectiveness in a variety of picture identification tasks, including crop disease
diagnosis. This research report focuses on employing the Inception V3 model, a cutting
edge architecture famous for its accuracy and efficiency, to detect diseases in rice plants
using the power of deep learning and CNNs.

**About Dataset**
 Total of 4058 original RGB coloured images of nine common rice leaf diseases including
 Tungro, Shathblight, NarrowBrownSpot, LeafScald, LeafBlast, Hispa, Healthy,BrownSpot,
 BacterialLeafblight are Rice Leaf Diseases Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Net
works
**Effect of epochs**
 The impact of epochs. Under normal parameters, the proposed CNN-based model is trained
 over a range of epoch counts up to 50. There are no more refinements in our model’s
 training and validation accuracy identified, making epoch 50 the best adjusted one. It is
 demonstrated that in the seventh to eighth epochs, the validation loss is nearly equal to
 the training loss. However, the validation accuracy is higher than the training accuracy at
 that point. Additionally, accuracy in training and validation is declining. Validation loss is
 nearly equal to training loss at epochs 22 and 23, and 25 and 26, respectively, however in
 the former example both metrics are still rising, while in the latter case both metrics are
 decreasing. During47th to 48th epochs, validation loss is closer to the training loss and the
 validation accuracy is at its peak. At this point, training accuracy is still increasing. From
 these observations, we stop training our model at the 50th epoch
**CONCLUSION**
 In this study, we provide a novel CNN-based model that can categorize five prevalent
 rice leaf diseases that are wide spreading. Our model has been trained to identify rice
 leaf illnesses in various image backdrops and photo-taking circumstances
## By using the **InceptionV3-Model**,acheived 97.729% accuracy with 50 epochs.
