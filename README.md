# Rice-Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Using-Inception-V3-Algorithm
One of the most important staple crops is rice, which is crucial to the worldâ€™s food security.
However, crop yield and global food production are seriously threatened by the illnesses that
are rapidly spreading among rice plants. Early disease diagnosis in rice plants is essential for
prompt treatment and efficient management to reduce possible losses. Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), a recent development in deep learning techniques, have demonstrated
astounding effectiveness in a variety of picture identification tasks, including crop disease
diagnosis. This research report focuses on employing the Inception V3 model, a cutting
dge architecture famous for its accuracy and efficiency, to detect diseases in rice plants
using the power of deep learning and CNNs.

## By using the **InceptionV3-Model**,acheived 97.729% accuracy with 50 epochs.
